<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  <!-- TODO abstract content -->
  <!-- TODO include link to Position Based Fluids paper -->
  Fluid simulation is a task within physics-based simulation which is used in
  film and video games to create the visual effect of water or other fluids.
  The density of a fluid, among other properties, affects how its particles
  interact in 3D space. We implemented Miles Macklin and Matthias Müller's
  paper <b>Position Based Fluids<b>, which considers fluids as as a set of
  particles that move at variable positions and velocities, subject to
  constraints such as vorticity that control the movement of the fluid. We
  retrofitted cloth simulation code from Berkeley's CS 184 Project 4, changed
  the simulation loop to implement density and pressure based updates, remodeled
  our code for remote training and fast simple local rendering, and created
  position based shaders to render the particles more realistically. Finally, we
  added a density slider to the GUI so that a user can change the
  density of the fluid in realtime while the simulation is rendering.

<h2>Technical Approach</h2>

<h3>Modifying Project 4 Starter Code for Fluids</h3>
<!-- TODO how we modified project 4 for our simulation-->
<!-- TODO include picture -->
<p>
    We began by modifying code from
    <a href="https://cal-cs184-student.github.io/p4-clothsim-rutajoshi/">Project 4: Cloth Simulation</a>.
    This involved building a 3-dimensional grid of point masses rather than a
    2-dimensional grid in which the point masses were connected by springs. We
    removed spring constraints and then changed the simulation loop to the
    position update loop given in Macklin's paper. We made some key changes to the
    paper's simulation loop, including re-ordering some of the inner loops for
    self-collision checking. Our updated version of the loop is below:

    <br><br>

    We also modified the cloth simulation code to render the point masses as OpenGL points of fixed radius. Later, we experimented
    with rendering them as spheres, using the sphere collision object from Project 4. We found that particle simulation alone
    was much faster, since rendering spheres with any type of shading took much more computation time.

</p>

<h3>Modifying Project 4 Starter Code for Remote Training</h3>
<!-- TODO how we modified project 4 for training on Hive machines-->
<!-- TODO include picture -->
<p>
  To improve the quality of our simulation, we had to render with more particles.
  However, increasing the number of particles severely decreased the speed of
  the simulation. To remedy this, we decided to outsource the computations
  of position updates to the hive machines by writing each position change to
  a file and removing the rendering functionality. At the start of each call to
  the simulate loop, we wrote the current position of the particle to a
  text file. After writing multiple files on the hive machines overnight, we
  read them back in a new simulate loop which updates particle positions by
  iterating through the lines in one of these text files.
</p>

<h3>Modeling Particles and Interactions with Planes</h3>
<!-- TODO plane and self collisions-->
<!-- generalized plane collision for any orientation -->
<p>
    We modeled plane collisions almost the same way we had modeled collisions
    for a cloth with a plane: when a point mass had a new predicted position
    which was within or on the other side of a plane as compared to the
    previous position, we moved the point mass to the correct side of the
    plane and maintained a small offset from the plane.

    To model self-collisions, we used the thickness of the cloth which was
    included in the original cloth simulation as a guideline for the minimum
    distance we enforced between particles. Whenever a point mass became less than a given
    thickness away from one of its neighbors, we displaced it in the direction
    away from the neighbor. After iterating through all the neighbors of the
    point mass, we applied a correction equal to the average of the corrections needed
    for the point mass to maintain its distance from each of the neighbors.

<h3>Fluid Simulation Loop: Technical Implementation</h3>
<!-- [done above] TODO show + explain pseudocode for Macklin and Muller loop, include main equations-->
<!-- TODO explain kernels-->
<!-- TODO group into main components of a fluid (as ordered by the paper or by pressure, vorticity, and viscosity)-->

<!-- TODO include picture -->
<p>
  This is the final simulation loop we implemented, inspired by Position Based
  Fluids with a few modifications:

  <br><br>

  <pre class="prettyprint">
    for all particles i do
      apply forces v_i ⇐ v_i + ∆t(f_{external} / mass)
      predict position x*_i ⇐ x_i +∆t(v_i)
    end for

    build a spatial map to find neighboring particles N_i for all point masses given predicted position x*_i

    while iter < solverIterations do
      for all particles i do
        calculate λ_i
      end for
      for all particles i do
        calculate ∆p_i (based on density and incompressibility constraints)
      end for
      for all particles i do
        update position x*_i ⇐ x*_i + ∆p_i
      end for
      for all particles i do
        check for self-collisions and displace particles that are too close to their neighbors
      end for
      for all particles i do
        for all collision objects co
            handle collision with point mass i (plane collisions)
        end for
      end for

      for all particles i do
        bound particle positions by the bounds of the containing 1x1x1 box
      end for
    end while

    for all particles i do
      update velocity v_i ⇐ (1/∆t)(x*_i − x_i)
      apply vorticity confinement and XSPH viscosity as updates to v_i
      update position x_i ⇐ x*_i
    end for
  </pre>

  <br><br>

  We move collision checking to be done after the update to the predicted
  position because the collision updates modify the predicted position directly
  rather than changing the delta that is calculated after the density and incompressibility
  constraints are applied.

  <br><br>

  We will now walk through each part of the loop.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  <!-- TODO include link to Position Based Fluids paper -->
  Fluid simulation is a task within physics-based simulation which is used in
  film and video games to create the visual effect of water or other fluids.
  The density of a fluid, among other properties, affects how its particles
  interact in 3D space. We implemented Miles Macklin and Matthias Müller's
  paper <a href="https://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf">Position Based Fluids</a>,
  which represents fluids as as a set of particles that move at variable positions
  and velocities, subject to constraints such as vorticity and viscosity, which
  constrain the movement of the fluid. We retrofitted cloth simulation code from
  Berkeley's CS 184 Project 4, changed the simulation loop to implement density
  and pressure based updates, remodeled our code for remote training and fast simple
  local rendering, and created position based shaders to render the particles more
  realistically. Finally, we added a density slider to the GUI so that a user can
  change the density of the fluid in realtime while the simulation is rendering.
</p>

<br><br>

<h2>Technical Approach</h2>

<h3>Fluid Simulation Loop</h3>
<!-- [done above] TODO show + explain pseudocode for Macklin and Muller loop, include main equations-->
<!-- TODO explain kernels-->

<!-- TODO include picture -->
<p>
  This is the final simulation loop we implemented, inspired by Macklin's Position Based
  Fluids paper, with a few modifications:

  <br><br>

  <div class="loop_box">
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      for all particles i do
        apply forces v_i ⇐ v_i + ∆t(f_{external} / mass)
        predict position x*_i ⇐ x_i +∆t(v_i)
      end for

      build a spatial map to find neighboring particles N_i for all point 
        masses given predicted position x*_i

      while iter < solverIterations do
        for all particles i do
          calculate λ_i
        end for

        for all particles i do
          calculate ∆p_i (based on density and incompressibility constraints)
        end for

        for all particles i do
          update position x*_i ⇐ x*_i + ∆p_i
        end for

        for all particles i do
          check for self-collisions and displace particles that are too close to 
            their neighbors
        end for

        for all particles i do
          bound particle position by the bounds of the containing box 
            (replaces plane collision-checking)
        end for
      end while

      for all particles i do
        update velocity v_i ⇐ (1/∆t)(x*_i − x_i)
        apply vorticity confinement and XSPH viscosity as updates to v_i
        update position x_i ⇐ x*_i
      end for
    </pre>
  </div>

  <br><br>
 <p>
  We moved the collision-checking code to be executed after the update to the predicted
  position. We did this because self-collision-checking updates modify the predicted position
  of a particle directly. The paper, in contrast, assumes collision-checking changes the delta which is
  calculated after the density and incompressibility constraints are applied.


  <br><br>

  We will now walk through each part of the loop.
</p>

<h4>External Forces</h4>
<!-- TODO picture -->
<p>
  We first applied external forces (e.g. gravity) to each particle. We take a force and calculate
  an acceleration from it by dividing by the particle mass (1 kg, which is trivial). Then, we account
  for this acceleration in the velocity and position of each point mass using discrete time updates
  given a timestep $\Delta t$.
</p>

<h4>Finding Neighbors</h4>
<!-- TODO hashing + neighbors -->
<p>
  We divided our unit cube into a grid, where each grid box has dimensions SxSxS. This allowed us to
  perform spatial hashing based on a particle's position. In a 3-dimensional grid, one grid box has neighboring
  boxes in all 3 axes - there is a 3x3x3 grid of boxes with the primary box at the center.

  To find neighbors, we could then query a hash map for the 27 boxes neighboring (and including) the grid box
  containing a particle. We then iterated through all of the particles that fell into these boxes and considered
  particles within a radius S from the input particle to be neighbors. This resulted in considering all particles
  in a sphere of radius S centered at the primary particle.

  The value of S was based on the average distance between particles. Since we were using a 10x10x10
  grid of particles in a 1x1x1 box, the average distance was 0.1. We multiplied this by 1.5 to increase
  particle cohesion, so that S = 0.15.
</p>

<h4>Incompressibility (Pressure and Density Constraints)</h4>
<!-- TODO pressure - incompressibility, tensile instability, discuss clumping / show video + picture -->
<p>
  Our next step was to enforce incompressibility, in which we maintain a constant density throughout the
  fluid. To do this, we displaced each particle relative to its neighbors so that the local density was
  constrained to be the same as the fluid's rest density.
  We were solving for the following constraint, in which <b>$\rho_i$</b> is the density of the particle, and
  <b>$\rho_0$</b> is the rest density of the fluid:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $ \large \mathcal{C}_i(\mathbf{p}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{p}_n) = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_0} - 1$
  </div>
  <br>

  To estimate the density of a particle, we use the following equation, where
  <b>$\mathcal{W}$</b> is the poly6 kernel. This kernel is used for smoothing and is equal to
  zero at the center:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $ \large \rho_i = \sum_j m_j \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)$
</div>
  <br>

  Given this, when we move a particle by a small amount, <b>$\Delta \mathbf{p}$</b>, the density
  constraint should still be valid. In other words:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $ \large\mathcal{C}(\mathbf{p} + \Delta \mathbf{p}) = 0$
  </div>
  <br>

  We solved for this constraint by applying Newton steps along a gradient:
  <br>
  <div align="middle">

    $\large \mathcal{C}(\mathbf{p} + \Delta \mathbf{p})  \approx \mathcal{C}(\mathbf{p}) + \nabla \mathcal{C}^T \Delta \mathbf{p} = 0$
  </div>
  <br>

  To solve for the delta in position, we needed to know the gradient of this constraint. We define this gradient
  with respect to a particle <b>$\mathbf{p}_k$</b> as:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $\large \nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} \mathcal{C}_i= \frac{1}{\rho_0}\sum_j \nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)$
  </div>
  <br>

  After that, we assigned a weight to the gradient, which defines how far we travel along
  our gradient. We do this differently for each particle, so we assign a variable <b>$\lambda_i$</b>
  as a weight for the gradient with respect to $i$th particle,
  <b>$\mathbf{p}_i$</b>:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $\large
    \lambda_i = -\frac{\mathcal{C}_i(\mathbf{p}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{p}_n)}{\sum_k \vert \nabla_{\mathbf{p}_k} \mathcal{C}_i \vert^2 + \epsilon}$
  </div>
  <br>

  Plugging the lambdas of a particle and its neighbors into the solved version of the Newton step,
  we get a delta for the position of a particle as follows:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $ \large
    \Delta \mathbf{p}_i = \frac{1}{\rho_0}\sum_j (\lambda_i + \lambda_j) \nabla \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)$

  </div>
  <br>
</p>

<h4>Tensile Instability</h4>
<p>
  However, this pressure update often results in particle clumping due to negative pressures that
  occur when a particle does not have enough neighbors. To remedy this, we add a factor <b>$s_{corr}$</b>
  to artifically introduce tensile instability into the pressure update:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $\large
    s_{corr} = -k \Bigg( \frac{\mathcal{W}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)} {\mathcal{W}(\Delta\mathbf{q}, h)}
    \Bigg) ^n $
  </div>
  <br>

  With this factor added in, our final pressure update becomes:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $ \large
    \Delta \mathbf{p}_i = \frac{1}{\rho_0}\sum_j (\lambda_i + \lambda_j + s_{corr}) \nabla \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)$

  </div>
  <br>
</p>

<h4>Vorticity</h4>
<!-- TODO vorticity - implemented a different version of eta from Bubbles Alive -->
<p>
  Vorticity accounts for turbulent motion, causing sloshing and
  circular movements within a fluid. We calculate the vorticity of a particle
  using the following estimator, where <b>$\mathbf{v}_{ij} = \mathbf{v}_j - \mathbf{v}_i$</b>:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $\large
    \omega_i = \nabla \times \mathbf{v} =  \sum_j \mathbf{v}_{ij}\times \nabla_{\mathbf{p}_j} \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)$
  </div>
  <br>

  <!-- TODO what is a location vector -->
  Additionally, we need a location vector, which is a vector pointing toward
  the center of the circular motion. We calculate the center of mass of a point mass
  and its neighbors:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">


    $ \large
    \mathbf{p}_i^{cm} = \frac{m_i \mathbf{p}_i + \sum_j m_j \mathbf{p}_j} {m_i+\sum_j m_j}$
  </div>
  <!-- <img src="final_images/vorticity/center_of_mass.png"/> -->
  <br>

  We use this to calculate a location vector <b>$\eta$</b>, which we normalize:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $\large \eta = \mathbf{p}_i^{cm}  - \mathbf{p}_i$
  </div>
  <!-- <img src="final_images/vorticity/eta.png"/> -->
  <br>

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $\large \mathbf{N} =  \frac{\eta}{\vert \eta \vert}$
  </div>
  <!-- <img src="final_images/vorticity/eta_normalized.png"/> -->
  <br>

  We then use the location vector <b>$\eta$</b> with a vorticity <b>$\omega_i$</b> to
  calculate a vorticity force:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $\large \mathbf{f}_i ^{vorticity} = \epsilon \big(\mathbf{N} \times \omega_i\big)$
  </div>
  <!-- <img src="final_images/vorticity/f_vorticity_i.png"/> -->
  <br>
</p>

<h4>Viscosity</h4>
<!-- TODO viscosity -->
<p>
  Viscosity defines how thick a fluid is. It also creates coherent motion within
  the fluid; particles that are close together move together. Thus, we have to
  adjust particles' velocities such that they are closer to the velocities
  of particles around them. We accomplish this with the following velocity
  update:

  <br>
  <div align="middle">
    $\large \mathbf{v}_i^{new} = \mathbf{v}_i + c\sum_j \mathbf{v}_{ij} \mathcal{W}(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_j, h)$
  </div>
  <!-- <img src="final_images/viscosity/viscosity_eq.png"/> -->
  <br>
</p>

<h3>Density Slider</h3>
<!-- TODO include picture -->
<p>
  We wanted to see changes in a fluid density in real time. We added a density
  slider similar to the sliders for Project 4 parameters. This slider adjusts
  the density as the simulation is running, meaning a fluid can start in the simulation
  like a liquid, and be modified to a gas immediately.
</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Modifying Project 4 Starter Code for Fluids</h3>
<!-- TODO how we modified project 4 for our simulation-->
<p>
  We began by modifying code from
  <a href="https://cal-cs184-student.github.io/p4-clothsim-rutajoshi/">Project 4: Cloth Simulation</a>.
  This involved building a 3-dimensional grid of point masses rather than a
  2-dimensional grid in which the point masses were connected by springs. We
  removed spring constraints and then changed the simulation loop to the
  position update loop given in Macklin's paper. We made some key changes to the
  paper's simulation loop, including re-ordering some of the inner loops for
  self-collision checking. Our updated version of the loop is below:

  <br><br>

  We also modified the cloth simulation code to render the point masses as
  OpenGL points of fixed radius. Later, we experimented with rendering them as
  spheres, using the sphere collision object from Project 4. We found that
  particle simulation alone was much faster, since rendering spheres with any
  type of shading took much more computation time.

</div>
<br>

<h3>Modifying Project 4 Starter Code for Remote Training</h3>
<!-- TODO how we modified project 4 for training on Hive machines-->
<!-- TODO include picture -->
<p>
  To improve the quality of our simulation, we had to easily render more particles.
  However, increasing the number of particles severely decreased the speed of
  the simulation. To remedy this, we decided to outsource the computations
  of position updates to the hive machines by writing each position change to
  a file and removing the rendering functionality. At the start of each call to
  the simulate loop, we wrote the current position of the particle to a
  text file. After writing multiple files on the hive machines overnight, we
  read them back in a new simulate loop which updates particle positions by
  iterating through the lines in one of these text files.

  We separated our code for testing, computation, and rendering into different
  branches to make debugging simpler.
</p>

<h3>Modeling Particles and Interactions with Planes</h3>
<!-- TODO plane and self collisions-->
<!-- generalized plane collision for any orientation -->
<p>
  We originally modeled plane collisions almost the same way we had modeled collisions
  for a cloth with a plane: when a point mass had a new predicted position which was within
  or on the other side of a plane as compared to the previous position, we moved the point
  mass to the correct side of the plane and maintained a small offset from the plane.

  However, we later realized the planes were not necessary for rendering - we could simply
  bound the particle positions inside the simulation loop to keep the particles within a
  rectangular box.

  To model self-collisions, we used the thickness of the cloth which was
  included in the original cloth simulation as a guideline for the minimum
  distance we enforced between particles. Whenever a point mass became less than a given
  thickness away from one of its neighbors, we displaced it in the direction
  away from the neighbor. After iterating through all the neighbors of the
  point mass, we applied a correction equal to the average of the corrections needed
  for the point mass to maintain its distance from each of the neighbors.

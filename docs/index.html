<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
  Our group is working on a fluid simulation. We are aiming to create a
  simulation for fluids with a density control to adjust the density of
  the fluid. In this way, we can test different kinds of fluids with
  the same simulation.
</p>

<br>

<h3>What We Have Accomplished</h3>
<p>
  We adapted our project 4 code to create a starting point for our fluid
  simulation. However, project 4 simulated the movement of a cloth, which
  differs from a fluid in many key ways. We changed the way we create our
  simulation in the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Our cloth is no longer a cloth. We create point masses, and do not
    create any springs, or any other connections between point masses.
    A cloth had particles that stuck together in a fixed fashion. In a
    fluid, the bonds between particles are less rigid.
  </li>
  <li>
    We needed to create a box in which our fluid will fall in. We changed
    the code to allow us to add multiple planes to one run of the simulation.
  </li>
  <li>
    We changed our rendering for point masses and planes. Our point masses
    are displayed as round blue spheres, and our planes are red squares.
  </li>
  <li>
    We removed multiple shader controls, since we are focused on particle
    interactions and not shading.
  </li>
  <li>
    We added slider controls for density.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  After this, we implemented the simulation loop in the following research
  paper (https://mmacklin.com/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf). This simulation loop
  contains checks for constraints on a fluid, including incompressibility,
  tensile instability, vorticity, and viscosity.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Preliminary Results</h3>
<p>
  We have multiple point masses, moving independently of each other. Our
  simulation has rendering changes to better display the movement of a
  fluid, as well as a density control for the fluid. We have implemented
  our simulation loop; however, the position function of our point masses
  diverges after a few time steps, which results in large point displacements.

<h3>Progress (Relative To Our Plan)</h3>
<p>
  We had three main goals in our plan. Our progress can be summarized as the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Fluid Simulation: </b> Core simulation loop for fluids is implemented.
    This is mostly done, with some bugs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Density Control: </b> Our simulation included a density control. This
    adjusts the density, but does not affect the movement of the fluid.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Particle Colorization</b>: We have not attempted gradient colorization of particles.
  </li>
</ul>
